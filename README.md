## About

This emacs lisp package lets you set a color-theme on a per-buffer basis.

## Requirements

This package uses [Emacs Face Remapping](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Face-Remapping.html) to installing faces locally on the buffer by means of `buffer-face-set` and `face-remap-set-base` functions.

## Installation

For color-theme.el themes
```
M-x package-install color-theme-buffer-local
```

For emacs24 themes
```
M-x package-install load-theme-buffer-local
```

If the above doesn't work, you may need to [configure your Emacs to
use the Marmalade repository](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and try
again.
